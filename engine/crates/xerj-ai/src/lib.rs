//! # xerj-ai
//!
//! AI-native features for the xerj search engine.
//!
//! Provides:
//! - [`embedder`] — Unified backend handle (lexical / proxy / Candle neural /
//!   experimental ONNX) used by the engine
//! - [`embed`]   — Embedding proxy: async HTTP client for OpenAI-compatible embedding APIs
//! - [`local`]   — Built-in zero-config deterministic text embedder (feature hashing)
//! - [`microbatch`] — Length-aware inference microbatching shared by the
//!   in-process backends (bounds one forward's activations, #366)
//! - [`neural`]  — Built-in neural BERT sentence embedder via candle (feature `neural`)
//! - `onnx`      — Experimental MiniLM-compatible FP32 ONNX backend
//!   (feature `onnx-experimental`; server feature + explicit runtime selection required)
//! - [`chunker`] — Text chunking with sentence-aware splitting and overlap
//!
//! Agent memory does NOT live here. The real memory store is index-backed
//! (`/_memory/*` in xerj-api over ordinary XERJ indices — durable, WAL-replayed,
//! kNN/BM25-searchable). An earlier in-RAM `AgentMemory` (O(N²) dedup scan, no
//! durability, process-lifetime only) was deleted once it reached zero callers:
//! keeping it around shadowed the real API and invited accidental use.
