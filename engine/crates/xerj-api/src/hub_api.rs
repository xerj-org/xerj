//! Corpus Hub v2 — the hosted, read-only endpoints (plan §6,
//! `docs/CORPUS_HUB_V2_IMPLEMENTATION.md`).
//!
//! Four `GET` routes under `/_hub/v1/` answer from the pre-indexed packs that
//! `xerj hub pull` restored on this node, so an agent with no clone and no
//! local index still gets an answer in one request:
//!
//! | Route | Answer |
//! |---|---|
//! | `GET /_hub/v1/catalogue` | the bytes of the file at `hub.catalogue_path`, `ETag` = its sha256, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`, `304` on a matching `If-None-Match` |
//! | `GET /_hub/v1/def/{slug}/{symbol}?k=` | an [`Answer`] from [`xerj_hub::def::lookup_in`] (the one `def` function the CLI uses) |
//! | `GET /_hub/v1/code/{slug}?q=&k=&max_tokens=&mode=` | an [`Answer`] built from [`xerj_common::xccode::run_code_query`] (the pipeline `xerj code` uses) |
//! | `GET /_hub/v1/search?q=&k=` | `{corpora:[{slug,best_score,best_hit}]}`, `multi_match` on `body,defs,symbol_text` across every pack index, grouped by corpus, best first, at most 10 |
//!
//! ## Limits (all four routes)
//!
//! `GET` only — any other method is `405` (behind authentication, unless
//! `hub.public` opens the route). Read-only: nothing here writes.
//! A corpus name must be in the catalogue (`404` otherwise, also for a name in
//! the catalogue with the `excluded` licence class — never served). `symbol`
//! and `q` are limited to [`MAX_INPUT_BYTES`] (`400`); `k` is clamped to
//! [`MAX_K`]. An unrecognised query parameter is a `400`, the way Elasticsearch
//! treats one, so a typo is never silently ignored.
//!
//! ## `hub.public` and the rate limit
//!
//! With `hub.public = true` exactly the four routes above — by exact path
//! shape, see [`is_public_path`] — skip authentication, authorization and the
//! audit log; `router.rs` wraps those three layers with a check that calls
//! [`is_public_request`]. Everything else on the node keeps all three. The
//! audit layer is skipped on purpose: it records every unauthenticated write-
//! shaped request, and a public route must not be a way to flush a bounded
//! evidence ring.
//!
//! `hub.public` makes the routes reachable by anyone, so they are rate-limited
//! per client address ([`RATE_LIMIT`] requests per [`RATE_WINDOW`], `429` with
//! `Retry-After`) — in both modes, so the limit never depends on how the node is
//! configured. `xerj-api` has no per-API-key limiter to reuse — the only
//! limiter in the crate is the share-claim one, which is private to
//! [`crate::share::ShareStore`] and shares a bounded table with claim
//! attempts, so hub traffic would throttle share claims. This module has its
//! own [`RateLimiter`]. The client address is [`crate::share::ClaimSource`]:
//! the TCP peer, believing `X-Forwarded-For` only from `server.trusted_proxies`.
//!
//! ## How a query reaches the engine — and why it is not a loopback call
//!
//! `lookup` and `run_code_query` are written against [`XcHttp`], a three-method
//! HTTP shell (`search`, `get_mapping`, `cat_indices_json`). The plan suggests
//! implementing it for the in-process case by calling the node's own loopback
//! address with the admin key. This module implements it **in-process
//! instead**: [`InProcessNode`] hands each call to a private router that holds
//! exactly the three read routes (`internal_router`) — the same handlers,
//! extractors and response encoding the real HTTP routes use, with no socket.
//! Reasons:
//!
//! * the node cannot reliably name its own address: `server.es_compat_port = 0`
//!   (ephemeral) is a supported configuration, `--port` rewrites ports, TLS may
//!   be on, and the bind address need not be loopback;
//! * no credential is needed, so no admin key is read from config or sent
//!   anywhere on a path a stranger can reach;
//! * the blocking client in `xerj-hub` (`HubNode`) has a 300 s timeout — far too
//!   long on a path a stranger can hold open — and would make the node an HTTP
//!   client of itself, a new kind of outbound connection for a server that
//!   publishes an inventory of every way data leaves it (`docs/RERANK.md`);
//! * the private router offers three read routes and nothing else, which is a
//!   smaller surface than "the admin key against the whole API".
//!
//! Four further guards bound what a hosted query can touch, even if a bug let
//! an unexpected name through:
//!
//! * [`InProcessNode`] refuses any index expression that is not made of `xc-`
//!   names in a conservative character set;
//! * every call runs under an engine-level [`index_guard`] that hides every
//!   index outside `xc-*` AND every index the caller's own request could not
//!   see. `HubVisibility` is the INTERSECTION of the hub namespace and the rule
//!   `authz_middleware` installed for the caller, captured before the work leaves
//!   the request's task: a key scoped to `tenant-a-*` is refused a corpus here
//!   exactly as it is by `_search`, and a hosted route is never a way to widen a
//!   grant;
//! * the ledger's `index_prefix` is pack-supplied text, so it is checked against
//!   the exact shape `xc-<slug>-b<digits>` for the corpus being asked about
//!   ([`valid_build_prefix`]) before any query is built from it, and a `def` or
//!   `code` request is then pinned to that build (`InProcessNode::pin_to_build`):
//!   the node refuses an index expression outside it, whatever the shared
//!   pipeline goes on to compute from its own second read of the ledger;
//! * the corpus name is checked against the catalogue before any filesystem path
//!   is built from it.
//!
//! The licence is decided the same way on every route: the STRICTER of the
//! catalogue's class and the corpus's own ledger's ([`effective_licence`]); either
//! can refuse (`excluded`), and either can require the read-do-not-copy warning
//! (`approach-only`).
//!
//! The `XcHttp` methods are synchronous and the handlers async, so each query
//! runs on the blocking pool (`run_query`) under a global concurrency cap
//! ([`MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES`], `503` + `Retry-After` when full) and a wall
//! clock timeout ([`QUERY_TIMEOUT`], `504`).
//!
//! ## What the in-process call changes about the search it makes
//!
//! The hub's call sets `es_compat::InProcessSearch`, a task-local that a request
//! off the wire cannot carry, and nothing else does:
//!
//! * **It is not audited.** The node's `_search` handler appends every search to
//!   the audit ring — 4,096 entries shared by the whole node — so one entry per
//!   public request would let a crowd of strangers age the operator's evidence out
//!   of it. The HTTP access log is the record of hub reads. (The audit LAYER in
//!   `router.rs` is skipped for the public routes for the same reason.)
//! * **A failing index is skipped, not fatal.** `search` fans out over every pack
//!   on the node, and the engine used to fail the whole request on the first index
//!   that errored: one pack with an unusable mapping took `search` down for every
//!   other pack. The index is skipped (logged, counted in `_shards.failed`); when
//!   EVERY index fails the first failure is the answer, so an outage is a `503`
//!   and never an empty list. `search` also sends `lenient`, which removes the
//!   commonest cause (a pack that maps `body` as a number) at the source.
//! * **An oversized response shrinks the window.** One in-process response is
//!   capped at 16 MiB (`MAX_INTERNAL_RESPONSE_BYTES`). `code` fetches whole records, ten
//!   times the `k` asked for, so two very large records overflow it even at
//!   `k=1`; the search is retried with half the window until it fits, and the
//!   answer says it was built from fewer candidates (`truncated: true`). A
//!   mapping read that overflows is a different matter — see `search` below.
//!
//! ## Known limits, stated so they are not rediscovered
//!
//! * `Answer.answered_from` is always `hosted` here: that is where the answer
//!   came from as far as the client is concerned, even though the server read a
//!   local pack.
//! * The shared query pipeline's JSON output does not report which arms ran for
//!   `mode=semantic|hybrid` (its "BM25 only" note is prose-only), so those
//!   modes carry a warning saying what each one DOES instead: `semantic` over a
//!   corpus with no `semantic_text` mapping returns no hits (it does not fall
//!   back), `hybrid` answers from BM25 alone.
//! * `search` reads the node-wide mappings to learn which of `body`, `defs` and
//!   `symbol_text` exist (this engine collapses a multi-token query to zero hits
//!   when a named field is mapped nowhere). If that read fails — typically
//!   because the mappings of every pack together are larger than the response
//!   cap — `search` is a `503`, not `{"corpora":[]}`, and the failure is
//!   remembered for a few seconds (`SEARCH_FIELDS_FAILURE_TTL`) so it is not recomputed by every
//!   request. A caller that runs under a visibility rule of its own reads (and
//!   shares) nothing from that cache.
//! * `search` queries `xc-*`, not the plan's `xc-*-docs,xc-*-defs`. This engine
//!   resolves index-name wildcards only as `*`, `prefix*` or `*suffix`
//!   (`glob_match_simple`, `es_compat.rs`), so a `*` in the middle of a name
//!   matches nothing: measured on this build, `xc-*-docs`, `xc-*-defs` and
//!   `xc-mini-*-docs` return zero hits where `xc-*`, `xc-m*` and an explicit
//!   list return the documents. The plan's pattern would make `search` answer
//!   "nothing matches" for everything, with a `200`. `xc-*` also covers every
//!   dataset index of a pack (autoindex names them after the repo's
//!   directories, not `docs`), so the route sees more of a pack than the plan's
//!   two suffixes would have. Hits that belong to no listed corpus are skipped.
